I am a PhD candidate in the history department at Michigan State University. My research explores the material and social history of northern Ghana. While the north is used as a regional designation, it also applies to groups found throughout the country who trace their hometowns to the savanna. I seek to understand how the movement and transformation of animal skins have forged connections between different northern communities and how this has changed over time.

I am also experienced in M&E projects in Africa, having worked as a project manager for a monitoring, evaluation, and research firm based in Accra, Ghana.
